### Project title
Find Me the One

### What and why?
This software aims to find the user the nearest restroom availale when they are in public. I remember that one time when I went shopping at Soho, it almost drove me crazy when I wanted to find a restroom but took a long time to find one. Soho was full of small boutiques that had no restrooms and I ended up going to the third floor of Bloomingdale and had to wait in a super long line. Therefore, if there is an app that I could search directly based on my location, I could have saved the time going into different stores to ask whether they have a restroom and avoided the Bloomingdale one which was too crowded. I think this would be helpful when people are in public places, especially in crowded cities like Manhattan.

### For whom?
People scattered on the streets of Manhattan.

### How?
1. Get the user's location.
2. Ask the user's preference of the restroom such as whether they are willing to wait in line or whether there is accessible facilty.
3. Get the result of the nearest restroom for the user.
4. More features could be added through developing...

### Scope
While this software will need a constant data collection and updates, the scope will be within the Manhattan, which I think will be pretty manageable for a group of 4-6 members.
